# Difference between Object.create and new operator

Object.create() create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. The
main difference between new operator and Object.create() is that new operator creates a new
instance using a constructor function. Object.create() creates a new instance using an existing
object as the prototype of the newly created object.
